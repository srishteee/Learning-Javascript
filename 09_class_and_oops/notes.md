# JS AND CLASSES 

Yes, JavaScript has classes! Classes in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a cleaner, more organized way to create objects and handle inheritance. JavaScript classes are essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance system, making it easier to work with object-oriented principles. JS IS PRIMARILY PROTOTYPE BASED LANGUAGE.
